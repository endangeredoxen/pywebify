PyWebify:  Rapid Browser-Based Report Visualization
===================================================

Everyone seems to be talking about data: some of it is "big"; some of it is
"driven".  But generally speaking, data are useless unless properly visualized
to point the investigator to correct conclusions.  Getting access to the right
data quickly can be challenging.  For example, imagine an analysis that yields
numerous plots, charts, images, and data tables.  How can these results be
investigated?  Navigating through a file directory can be cumbersome, slow,
and inefficient.  Common tools like Powerpoint quickly become intractable
unless the number of plots and charts included is kept small, leaving no path
to drill down further into the nitty-gritty details when questions arise.
Saving reports in proprietary software like JMP or exensio provides better
flexibility but also requires your organization to fork over lots of cash for
license fees.

PyWebify attempts to mitigate these issues by enabling data report
visualization within a common web browser.  It is completely free and open-
source and runs using Python.  Designed primarily for scientists and engineers,
PyWebify quickly hyperlinks large numbers of images, plots, tables, or
generic html files into a customizable, easily-navigable, and searchable
html report.
